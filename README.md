<h1>Demonstration of Android Repackaging Attack </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
An Android repackaging attack is a type of cyberattack where a malicious actor takes a legitimate Android application (APK file), modifies it to include malicious code, and then redistributes it as if it were the original app. This process typically involves reverse-engineering the app, altering its code or resources, and repackaging it into a new APK file that looks and behaves similarly to the original but contains hidden malicious functionality.
